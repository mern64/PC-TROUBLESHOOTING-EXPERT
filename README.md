# PC-TROUBLESHOOTING-EXPERT
 
A PC Troubleshooting Expert System is an intelligent, interactive tool designed to diagnose and resolve common computer issues efficiently. By simulating the decision-making process of a human technician, this system guides users through a structured troubleshooting flow, helping them identify problems and implement solutions without requiring advanced technical knowledge.

**Key Features:**
1. **Step-by-Step Diagnosis** :
   	- Presents targeted questions to narrow down potential issues
   	- Analyzes symptoms (freezing, crashes, slow performance, etc.)
			<br/>
			<br/>
2. **Automated Solutions**
   	-	Analyzes symptoms (freezing, crashes, slow performance, etc.)
   	- Provides clear, actionable fixes (e.g., ending high-CPU tasks, checking hardware)
   	- Includes visual guides (screenshots, GIFs) for complex steps
   <br/>
			<br/>
3. **Hardware, Software & Peripheral Coverage**
   -	Addresses RAM/CPU failures, overheating, malware, disk errors, and driver issues
   -	Recommends tools (Task Manager, chkdsk, antivirus scans)
   <br/>
			<br/>
4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Simple "Yes/No" navigation with progress tracking
   - Mobile-responsive design for accessibility
   <br/>
			<br/>
5. **Preventive Guidance**
   - Mobile-responsive design for accessibility
   - Simple "Yes/No" navigation with progress tracking
   - Offers maintenance tips to avoid future problems
   - Educates users about system monitoring

**How It Works:**
The system uses a rule-based decision tree to replicate expert logic. Users answer questions about their PC’s behavior, and the system dynamically adjusts its recommendations based on responses, ultimately delivering a tailored solution.

</br>
Example Flow:</br>
Q: Is your PC overheating?</br>
Yes → Clean fans/reapply thermal paste</br>
No → Check for malware</br>

This approach minimizes guesswork, reduces downtime, and empowers users to resolve issues independently.
